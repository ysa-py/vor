## Overview

UAC SNI Spoofer Windows is a Windows network dashboard built around Xray and the Patterniha SNI-spoofing method.

The application manages carrier-specific routes, scans and ranks SNI and Edge pairs, applies the Windows proxy automatically, and restores the previous proxy state when the connection is stopped or the app exits.

The desktop profiles are tuned separately for **MCI / Hamrah Aval** and **IranCell**, so changing one carrier does not overwrite or break the other carrier's settings.

## Features

- Separate MCI, IranCell, and Auto carrier modes
- Xray-based local SOCKS/HTTP tunnel
- Optional system-wide sing-box TUN mode for Windows TCP and UDP traffic
- Mobile Gateway for sharing the active connection with devices on the local network
- Patterniha SNI and Edge scanner with live results
- MCI TLS startup optimization
- YouTube route warmup for faster video startup
- Suggested configuration ranking using real page checks and bounded download tests
- Persian and English interface with RTL/LTR support
- App Bypass
- Live logs
- Public IP check
- Advanced tuning for route, SNI, DNS, timeout, and fallback behavior
- GitHub Releases update checker
- Safe Windows proxy restore after disconnect, exit, or restart

## TUN mode

`Windows Proxy` remains the default mode. When `TUN Mode` is enabled, the app creates a `UAC-Spoofer` virtual interface with sing-box and sends Windows TCP and UDP traffic through the local Xray SOCKS listener, the Patterniha core, and the active config. The app verifies a real YouTube route through the TUN interface before reporting the connection as active.

SOCKS, VLESS, and Trojan do not transport ICMP. Ping requests therefore use a dedicated Direct rule over the physical interface so CMD reports real network latency. Web pages and video traffic continue through the tunnel.

Disabling TUN while connected removes its interface and routes immediately. If Windows Proxy is enabled, that mode is restored automatically. App Bypass process names are also translated into direct sing-box route rules.

## Mobile Gateway

Enable `Mobile Gateway` on the Home page to automatically discover devices on the same local network and route their traffic through the active UAC Spoofer connection. Mobile phones and other devices can keep their normal DHCP settings without manually configuring a proxy or static IP address.

The badge beside the option shows the number of connected devices. Select it to view each device's IP address and connection state. Disconnecting the VPN, disabling Mobile Gateway, or exiting the application removes the gateway configuration and restores the previous Windows network state.

## Carrier support

This application is tuned for the following carriers:

- MCI / Hamrah Aval
- IranCell

In `mci` mode, the app uses the independent MCI profile. In `irancell` mode, it uses the independent IranCell profile. For the most stable result, select your current carrier manually.

## Portable version

The portable version is prepared for users who do not want to install Python or extra dependencies.

How to run:

1. Download the following file from GitHub Releases:

```text
UAC-Spoofer-Desktop-v1.0.8-Windows-x64-portable.zip
```

2. Extract the full ZIP archive.
3. Keep the `_internal` folder beside the executable file.
4. Run:

```text
UAC-Spoofer-Desktop.exe
```

5. Accept the Windows UAC prompt if it appears.

Python is not required for the portable build.

## Run from source

Requirements:

- Windows 10/11 x64
- Python 3.11 or 3.12

Run:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install-engine.ps1
python main.py
```

## Carrier mode

The application includes multiple carrier modes:

- `mci`: independent MCI / Hamrah Aval route, SNI, Edge, benchmarks, and tuning
- `irancell`: independent IranCell route and tuning
- `auto`: app-managed automatic profile

For the most stable and deterministic result, select your current carrier manually.
