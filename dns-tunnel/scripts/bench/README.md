# MasterDnsVPN Benchmark Suite

This directory contains the core benchmarking tools for MasterDnsVPN, now enhanced with high-precision timing and standalone tool capabilities inspired by the `slipstream-rust` methodology.

## Tools

### 1. `bench.go` (Go-based Orchestrator and Benchmarker)

The primary tool for end-to-end performance testing. It builds the server and client, orchestrates a local tunnel, and measures throughput using **First-Byte Timing**.

#### High-Precision Timing
Unlike simple timers, `bench.go` starts its measurement only when the **first byte** of the actual payload is sent or received. This ensures that connection establishment and handshake overheads do not skew the results, providing a true measure of tunnel throughput.

#### Usage (Full Orchestration)

To run a standard end-to-end benchmark through the MasterDnsVPN tunnel:

```bash
go run scripts/bench/bench.go -runs 3 -bytes 10485760
```

#### CLI Options
| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-runs` | Number of runs for each direction | 3 |
| `-bytes` | Total payload size in bytes | 10MiB |
| `-force-build` | Rebuild server and client binaries | true |
| `-client-port` | Port for the local client listener | 18080 |
| `-server-port` | Port for the UDP server listener | 5300 |

### 2. Standalone Mode (Tool Mode)

`bench.go` can also be used as a standalone source/sink tool, similar to `tcp_bench.py`. This is useful for testing manual configurations or other TCP links.

#### Modes
- `sink`: Listens for a connection and discards received data (sends "OK" at the end).
- `source`: Listens for a connection and sends data.
- `send`: Connects to a target and sends data (waits for "OK" at the end).
- `recv`: Connects to a target and receives data.

#### Examples

**Start a sink server (receiver):**
```bash
go run scripts/bench/bench.go -mode sink -addr :9090
```

**Run a sender (client):**
```bash
go run scripts/bench/bench.go -mode send -addr 127.0.0.1:9090 -bytes 100000000
```

**JSON Output:**
To get raw data for analysis:
```bash
go run scripts/bench/bench.go -mode send -addr 127.0.0.1:9090 -json
```

## Directory Structure

- `.bench/local_snapshot_go/bin`: Compiled benchmark binaries.
- `.bench/local_snapshot_go/runtime`: Temporary configuration and log files.

## Methodology

1. **First-Byte Start**: The timer starts on the first successful `Read` or `Write` of the payload.
2. **ACK Synchronization**: For "Exfil" scenarios, the sink sends an "OK" acknowledgment to ensure all data has cleared the tunnel before the timer stops.
3. **Monotonic Timing**: Uses Go's monotonic clock for sub-millisecond precision.
